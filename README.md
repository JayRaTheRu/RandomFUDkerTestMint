# Magma:Onyx TESTNET FUDker Card Edition

Welcome to the **Magma:Onyx TESTNET FUDker Card Edition**, an experimental RANDOM style mint of NFTs on the Magma Onyx Testnet as we prepair for our mainnet launches! FUDkers are people who seek + embody FORTITUDE, UNDERSTANDING, and DETERMINATION, striving to uplift and empower others in the process.

## Overview

This project features **14 unique TESTNET FUDker collecting cards**, with **100 NFTs per FUDker**, culminating in a total of **1,400 NFTs**. These digital collectibles are a playful nod to the FUD that pervades the crypto space, turning it into something fun and collectible.

We're all FUDkers here, experimenting, learning, and fine-tuning our blockchain endeavors. Join us in **The Neighborhood On The BLockchain**, where we embrace the uncertainty and make it our own.

## Features

- **Randomized Minting**: Each mint gives you a chance to receive any one of the 14 unique FUDker cards. The distribution is entirely random, ensuring a fair and exciting experience for everyone involved.
- **Limited Edition**: With only 100 NFTs available per FUDker, these cards are exclusive and limited. Make sure to get your hands on them before they run out!
- **Testnet Experimentation**: This project is currently in its experimental phase on the Ethereum testnet. It's a great opportunity for participants to engage with NFTs without the financial risks associated with mainnet transactions.
